# Calculator App

A basic calculator application that implements a post-fix stack algorithm to calculate a basic expression. 
Contains other fragments which were used to learn more about fragments, navgraphs, and layouts. 

## Ideas for future improvement

* Include more math operators, i.e square root, exponential, brackets, etc. 
* Switch stack-based implementation to a recursive tree of expression objects. 
* Improve layout design and functionality to support every platform device of all aspect ratios.
